<h1>Privacy Policy for Sortify AI</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 31, 2025</p>

<p>
Sortify AI operates the SortifyAI mobile application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect user information.
</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<h3>Camera Permission (android.permission.CAMERA)</h3>
<p>
We use your device camera to capture images of waste items for AI-powered classification.
Images are processed locally on your device and are not stored or transmitted to our servers
unless you explicitly choose to share them.
</p>

<h3>Photo / Media Access (READ_MEDIA_IMAGES / READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)</h3>
<p>
The app may access your device’s photo gallery to allow you to select existing images for
classification. You have full control over which images are selected. These images are used
only for classification and are not uploaded or stored externally.
</p>

<h3>Location Permission (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION / ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)</h3>
<p>
Location access is used to display nearby recycling centers and waste disposal facilities on
the map. Location data is not stored, tracked, or shared with third parties. You may continue
using most app features without granting location access.
</p>

<h3>Internet Permission (android.permission.INTERNET)</h3>
<p>
Internet access is required for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Firebase authentication</li>
    <li>Syncing user activity across devices</li>
    <li>Displaying map data and recycling center information</li>
    <li>Leaderboard and real-time updates</li>
</ul>

<h2>User Data We Collect</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Email address (for account authentication)</li>
    <li>Activity data (items scanned, points earned, game scores)</li>
    <li>Day streak and scanning statistics</li>
    <li>Leaderboard rankings</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>
All user data is securely stored using Firebase Realtime Database with industry-standard
encryption. Authentication is managed through Firebase Authentication using secure protocols.
We take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> Authentication, database, and secure data storage</li>
    <li><strong>Google Maps API:</strong> Displaying recycling center locations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.
Leaderboard information may be visible to other users using anonymized or user-selected display
names. Scanned images are not shared unless you explicitly choose to do so.
</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>
User data is retained while your account remains active. You may request account deletion at
any time, after which all associated data will be permanently deleted.
</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
Sortify AI is designed for a general audience, including users under the age of 13.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children without parental consent.
If you believe a child has provided personal data without consent, please contact us so we
can take appropriate action.
</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Access your personal data</li>
    <li>Request correction of inaccurate data</li>
    <li>Request deletion of your account and data</li>
    <li>Disable location access while continuing to use other features</li>
</ul>
